# blog-site

Blog Website created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Node.JS as the back-end.  This project was my first attempt at using EJS (Embedded Javascript Templating).  EJS was used to take the heavy lifting out of displaying the blog posts and maintaining the same style and structure across the different routes of the website.
